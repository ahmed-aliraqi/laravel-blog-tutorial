### Laravel ide helper package

This package generates a file that your IDE understands, so it can provide accurate autocompletion. Generation is done based on the files in your project, so they are always up-to-date. If you don't want to generate it, you can add a pre-generated file to the root folder of your Laravel project (but this isn't as up-to-date as self generated files).
